## Analysis of *Hesperia Comma* Forewing Length as a response of Global Warming.

A study into the ecological effects of climate change conducted on *Hesperia Comma,* a univoltine British butterfly species. As an ectotherm, its phenology is intrinsically linked to the environment, especially temperature; which can be used as an indicator of the effects of warming temperatures on ecology. 58 museum butterfly specimens of mixed sex from the month of June between 1880-1973 were used. The forewing length was measured, and the year, temperature, sex and rainfall for each specimen was recorded. The following hypotheses were analysed: do average June temperatures increase with years passed? Does forewing length increase in conjunction with this? And is this affected by sex?
